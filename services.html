  <h1>Bala Chaitanyam</h1>
  <p>Bala Chaitanyam works on the two core principles of learning. 1. One can never teach what one does not know. 2. The teachers become proficient as they teach. Elder children teach the younger children.
    In the attached photo the elder children (called 'captains) who teach are examining some maps and charts (a benefactor bought 33 maps and charts). They are trying to read and understand the contents so that they can teach younger children the contents. They enjoy showing the maps and charts and talk about them to younger children.</p>

  <h1>Superstitions and the fear</h1>
  <p>Superstitions and the fear thereof is one of the major blocks in the path of growth of young people in rural areas and urban slums. The Society, as parts of the efforts to eradicate superstitious fears, made an effort. The Society launched a CHNPS (pronounced 'chimps') challenge. See the attached photo. It contains five things, CHNPS. C= (a piece of) cloth, H= (cut) hair, N=(cut) nails, P=photo and S=(a little of matti) soil on which the challenger walked. They are placed in a cover and are made available to anybody who can perform witchcraft (chetabadi, banamathi etc.). Anonymity of the performer is assured if the performer wants it. The successful performer will get, after scrutiny, Rs 10,000/- as prize for the performance.</p>

    <h1>Visiting Grampanchyath</h1>
    <p>My visit to Gaddigudem Tanda village, 10 km from Mahaboobabad on 15Sept'19 excited me. I went there on an invitation from Mohd Rashid, a ward member of the Panchayat of the village. I met the young people and some bright and active children of the village. I saw a will and enthusiasm in the young people to develop skills, chaitanyam and positive leadership.
        I gave them the Preamble calendars and a few pamphlets of the to help them think and question. See how curiously and deeply some young children were looking into the Preamble calendar!</p>
